** Regex
*** Escape and r-string
- If we don't use r-string, we need double backslash for escaping. (Although in some (most?) cases, single backslash seems to work)
****  [!] Do we need to escape hyphen? [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/9589642][`SO`]]
- There's a small problem with the example given in the SO answer above. In ~[a-z\-0-9]~, the hyphen in the middle doesn't need to be escaped. Let's just play it safe and put ~-~ at the end of the pattern.
- Hyphen can apply to character in ASCII order.

** What is PEP8, pep8, flake8, black etc.
- PEP8: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
- pep8: a tool to check your Python code against some of the style conventions in PEP 8.
- pyflakes: A simple program which checks Python source files for errors.
- flake8: pyflakes+pep8
- black/autopep8/yapf: formatter
** Formatter Comparison: Black vs Yapf vs autopep8
*** After reading these, I think black is better:
- https://www.kevinpeters.net/auto-formatters-for-python
- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17155048
- https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/8sbipd/why_do_people_prefer_black_over_yapf/
*** Black's good point
- Consistency
- Minimal config
*** Black's ambivelant point
- Enforce double quotation mark
** Black:
*** E203 not pep8 compliant, but false positive in pep8 (flake8)
