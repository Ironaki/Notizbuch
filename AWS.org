* DynamoDB
** General
*** Python SDK (boto3) [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GettingStarted.Python.html][Tutorial]]
Link above is better than the docs IMO
**** Low level API
- [?] Seems like there is a [[https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/dynamodb.html][low-level API]] as well. Might require data type to be specified
- [!] Problem: [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44377713/how-to-add-item-to-string-set-on-dynamodb-with-boto3][[S] Add string to a set]]
  + solved by not specifying data type
** Operations
*** Query
**** Second Index available for query
[[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SecondaryIndexes.html][Improving Data Access with Secondary Indexes]]
*** Scan
[?] Batch like operation is needed [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GettingStarted.Python.04.html][link]]
